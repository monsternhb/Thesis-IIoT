This is a simple website that I did by myself to practice my knowledge about web programming and using it for my thesis.
Goals: Application of IIoT and construction of a web server system to manage, control, and monitor automation systems, in particular color rating systems color and heating systems.
Plan:
1. Building a product classification model on PLC S7-1200.
2. Building a color product classification algorithm based on the theory of processing imaging and machine vision based on C#.
3. Build Flow to communicate between PLC S7-1200 and Webserver on the platform Node-red.
4. Build a Webserver for monitoring and controlling systems.
5. Communication between Webserver and Winform C# to change processing parameters images via the MQTT protocol.
